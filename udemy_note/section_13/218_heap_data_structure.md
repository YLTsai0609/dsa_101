# Heap

A more efficient utilization of priority queues.

Using heap data structure, we can perform both insertion and deletion in much better way.

1. the value of the node should be greater or equal to those in its children.(we'll use it in the Tree-based deep learning model)

2. [binary tree should be complete binary tree.](../section_10/153_complete_binary_tree.md)

3. If property 1 is greater than, we have **max heap**. On the oppisite, we have **min heap**

# Examples

left is a heap, right is a not a heap.

left is a heap, right is not a heap.

note that there is no need to compare the value of node between the neighbor's.

neighter of them are heap.
