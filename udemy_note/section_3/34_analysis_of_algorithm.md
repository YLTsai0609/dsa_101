# Experimental Analysis

Pros :

1. easy

Cons:

1. Limited input
2. Hardware(CPU, GPU) and software(complier, interpreters, garbage collectors) dependent
3. Operating system dependent
4. difficult to predict the precise running time.

# Theoretical Analysis

Pros:

1. independent on hardware and software
2. independent on operating system
3. all possible input
